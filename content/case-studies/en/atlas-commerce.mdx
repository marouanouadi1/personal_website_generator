  <CaseStudy.Setup title="Modernizing launches for regional teams" summary="Atlas needed to activate eight country storefronts without inflating a lean enablement team.">
    <p>
      Atlas Commerce started as a single-market storefront that relied on bespoke theme edits every time a new campaign launched.
      The merchandising team could not keep up with localization requests and the checkout stack splintered into four forks.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Campaigns were blocked behind engineers because the CMS fed hard-coded blocks.</li>
      <li>Marketing, product, and lifecycle teams worked from different design files and component names.</li>
      <li>Regional general managers were launching paid media while landing pages lagged by weeks.</li>
    </ul>
  </CaseStudy.Setup>

<CaseStudy.Framing
  title="Framing success with a SFDRR scorecard"
  summary="We aligned the core squad on what success felt like before writing a line of code."
>
  <p>
    I facilitated a working session with marketing, product, and engineering leads using
    the SFDRR rubric so every decision traced back to the same outcomes. We plotted the
    current experience on a scale of stability, flexibility, differentiation, reach, and
    retention. The exercise showed we were over-invested in differentiation while
    stability and reach lagged far behind.
  </p>
  <p>From there we defined guiding guardrails:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Every module should ship in one market and scale to the others without code edits.
    </li>
    <li>
      The design system needed to express marketing and product surfaces with one set of
      tokens.
    </li>
    <li>
      Localized offers should publish in under thirty minutes from a structured form.
    </li>
  </ol>
</CaseStudy.Framing>

<CaseStudy.Delivery
  title="Shipping value in layered increments"
  summary="We sequenced delivery so each release unlocked a tangible launch while the system matured behind the scenes."
>
  <p>We tackled three streams in parallel:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Foundation.</strong> Partnered with engineering on a typed content schema
      and introduced MDX-driven marketing pages so regions could stage layouts without
      shipping new builds.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Experience.</strong> Rebuilt the storefront shell with responsive
      primitives, checkout flags, and runtime experiments that matched marketing pages by
      default.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Operations.</strong> Documented playbooks, introduced async QA rituals, and
      built automation that mirrored production inventory for dry-runs.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Every shipment included a "show the receipts" review where we walked through the SFDRR
    scores and ensured we were improving stability and reach before chasing polish. It
    kept the roadmap honest and our stakeholders aligned on why some bespoke requests were
    parked.
  </p>
</CaseStudy.Delivery>

<CaseStudy.Results
  title="Demonstrating measurable lift"
  summary="Twelve weeks after the first release we had the data to prove the new operating model."
>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Launch velocity:</strong> Regional storefronts shipped an average of four
      releases per month, up from three releases per quarter.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Checkout consistency:</strong> Error rates dropped by 18% because
      promotions, pricing, and cart flows pulled from a single source.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Enablement load:</strong> The central merchandising team reclaimed one week
      per month thanks to the typed content pipeline.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Qualitatively, sales leadership finally used the storefront as a demo asset. They
    could launch a localized experience for prospects during the pitch instead of showing
    static decks.
  </p>

  <CaseStudy.Reflection
    title="What I would repeat and what I would evolve"
    summary="The work validated the SFDRR cadence while surfacing a few improvements for the next cycle."
  >
    <h3>Keep</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Grounding every planning session in the SFDRR scorecard so trade-offs stayed transparent.</li>
      <li>Shipping shared patterns on marketing and product surfaces at the same time to reinforce the new design language.</li>
      <li>Running async "show the receipts" walkthroughs to celebrate the switch from bespoke work to system contributions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Adjust</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Budget extra time to mentor regional contributors on MDX syntax; we underestimated the learning curve.</li>
      <li>Automate a few of the QA rituals once the launch schedule stabilizes to keep burn-out in check.</li>
    </ul>
