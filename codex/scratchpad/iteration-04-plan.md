# Iteration Plan

1. Define localized copy and structured project metadata for the work listing in `messages/en.json` and `messages/it.json`.
2. Build a `/[locale]/work` route that pulls the content, renders the header, and passes structured data into a client listing component.
3. Implement a client-side work listing with filter controls and project cards, ensuring accessible interactions and responsive layout.
4. Add any supporting utilities/styling tweaks as needed, then run lint, type check, and tests before committing.
