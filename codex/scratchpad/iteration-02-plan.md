# Iteration Plan

1. Rework the home hero markup/styles to deliver responsive clamp-based typography and better spacing while reusing existing copy.
2. Layer in a lightweight entrance animation using Tailwind's animate utility so the text and CTAs reveal smoothly on load.
3. Keep the dual CTAs accessible/responsive, then run lint + type checks before committing the change.
